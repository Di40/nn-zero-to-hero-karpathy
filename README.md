# nn-zero-to-hero-karpathy
This repo contains my notebooks and experiments while following Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" course. Started with NN fundamentals, and then built and trained complex models from scratch (including an LLM like GPT). I extended the lessons by using a custom scraped dataset.
